# Week 45 - Building


## Building and testing

This week the final Peltier elements finally arrived, so we can now test all of the cooling possibilities in practice. We have performed additional measurements and experiments and believe that the new elements are the best ones for this project. 

We had a hands-on prototype-building workshop, where we worked towards making the prototype a reality. We attached the elements to an actual cap in different configurations and tried powering them with batteries and solar panels.

The sensation of cold was very strong in the first few seconds. However, after about 10 seconds the sensation disappeared. This may be because your body gets used to the constant effect, or because the element begins to heat up. The latter is more likely, since our current prototype has a layer of tape and cloth on the hot side of the element, trapping the heat inside. Instead, we should cut holes into the cloth and attach the elements some other way than with tape. We should then look into attaching a heat sink to the hot side to dissipate the heat better.

Another way to improve the cold sensation would be to have the cooling turn on and off. Ideally this would be on an automatic cycle on the order of 10 seconds, but for our prototype we could simulate it with a manual switch. In order to not waste power, we could switch the left side on when we turn the right side off, and vice versa.

Next we will purchase more components to try out these ideas.

## Survey part two

We wanted to do another round of surveys, so we made some improvements to the current one. We added a short introductory text explaining the purpose of the survey to the beginning. We also pinpointed some key questions we wanted answered:

- What kind of people would use the cap?
- What do people think of the current design?
- How much are people willing to pay for the cap?

The survey is now split into sections that correspond to these questions. Compared to the previous survey, not too much was changed. Reordering, rewriting and removing some redundant questions was enough polish for now. We felt that the first survey contained most of what we needed, we just need more answers.
