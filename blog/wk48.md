# Week 48 - Rehearsing for Grand Finale

The final rehearsal for the the Finale didn’t go as planned and we weren’t able to attend. Also due to sickness practising and filming our presentation was left to the very last moment and had to be done in a home office.

The Grand Finale is right around the corner and we are very excited for our project to come to an end!
