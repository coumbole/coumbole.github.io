# Week 42 - User Feedback

__Building the prototype__

We started building the first prototype using a regular cap, some aluminium foil to simulate solar panels and pieces of cardboard to simulate the Peltier cooling elements. Aluminium foil resembles the panels closely enough to provide important feedback on how the panels can be placed and how large their surface area is going to be approximately. The sample panels we received from Janne where varying, and some of them were flexible, which is rather crucial for our product. Foil resembled this behaviour quite well.

Simulating the cooling elements was a little bit more challenging. We did not have the exact specifications of the elements, and of course simulating the cooling effect was not going to be possible at this point. Due to this, we used folded pieces of cardboard to give an idea of the added thickness and weight of the elements.

Some aspects of the actual product were not simulated at this point. For example the wirings from the solar panels to the elements were left out of the prototype, as we did not consider them to be as crucial at this point as the cooling elements and panels.

__Building the product__

At the start of the week we ordered components from Amazon. We decided to order two different kinds of peltier elements with different specifications to give us options to try different configurations with solar panels. The components should arrive in 1-2 weeks, and we look forward to trying them out in practice. 

Meanwhile, we have been reading the data sheets of the components to try to estimate how much cooling we can realistically achieve. We will not be able to power the peltier elements at the at the maximum accepted voltage and current, but according to our interpretation of the specs, we will should still get a measurable amount of cooling.  

__Friday presentation__

On Friday we had our second presentation. Our project had changed significantly since our first presentation, but the change of focus was welcomed. There was a lot of interested discussion after the presentation. There were some concerns about the style of the design presented, and a very valid question about the healthiness of having cold elements stuck to the head. The audience recognized the novelty of our product, and the challenges in implementing it successfully, but, as one feedback said, “creating a perfect product should not even be the goal of the project”.

__User Feedback__

We decided to start with a user survey about about our product concept, including the first sketches. The reason for choosing this type of feedback is that the concept is still developing and we don’t have any working prototype yet. Additionally, this enables us to easily get feedback from potential users from other countries, which might help us to define our market. 

In this survey we had a sample size of 11 people. This is definitely on the small side, and repeated testing is needed for us to be able to draw any solid conclusions, but it is a very valuable start for us.

8 out of 11 respondents lived in Finland or Sweden, so we don’t expect them to be those who have experienced the most discomfort from heat. However, most considered themselves outdoor people, and reported doing outdoor activity in sunny conditions.

As most of the respondents were located in the Nordics, 81.8 % is a surprisingly high percentage of people who have been restricted from outdoor activities by sun or heat. Most likely the percentage will not be lower in warmer countries, which justifies the use case of our product. There is a need for cooling down while doing outdoor activities in the nordics as well.

The vast majority of respondents appreciate the use of solar power. It shows environmental values are important to young adults, which is a trend that favours our product. However, even if the user does not especially value the product being solar-powered does not mean they do not find it useful.

![prototype](/resources/w42/cost.png)

Almost half of the responses considered 50 € to be the price cap for the product. The novelty of the product (wearable electronics + cooling headwear) probably makes it more “risky” to spend a lot of money on. Nobody has heard any positive (or negative for that matter) comments or feedback of such products.

The majority of answers (20-50 €) are in the same price range as 30 €, a typical price for a sports cap from a brand like Under Armour or New Era. So while most respondents say they appreciate the solar-poweredness, it doesn’t appear to increase their valuation of the product significantly.

Only two respondents had used wearable electronics before (GPS watches and smart watches). This suggests that smart clothes are still some way away from the mainstream.

We also got some free-form comments on the product. Firstly, there is concern about the comfort of head cooling, which echoes the feedback we got during the Friday presentation. This is something we will test as soon as possible, to see if this product is viable. Secondly, not everyone is a fan of the baseball cap aesthetics, and were asking for different designs. Since this is not directly connected to the core concept, this concern will be addressed later. 

For our future user testing or surveys we aim to increase the sample size and improve the distribution, since most of our answers were from 20-30 year-olds from Scandinavia. We will also improve our  questions to make them clearer and less ambiguous.
