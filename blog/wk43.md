# Week 43 - Reflections

## Meeting with Janne

This week we reached a significant milestone in our project: Actually converting light into a cooling effect.

On Friday Gustav and Teo met with Janne Halme, who suggested our topic. We presented the current version of our product idea and discussed about the feedback we’ve gotten, both from the potential end-users and fellow students in this course. According to Janne, our idea is novel and interesting, and fits this course well because getting authentic user feedback and iterating on it is possible. He had concerns about the technical validity of achieving true cooling, but made the interesting point that even a product that only achieves the _sensation_ of cooling can be worthwhile. Still, he had doubts whether anyone would want the product.

Last week, we ordered Peltier elements (or Thermoelectric Cooling elements), and the first one arrived this week. When connecting it to a 1.5 V or 9 V battery, you instantly notice the effect: One side gets cold, and the other get hot. This is hardly surprising, the real question is whether we can accomplish the same using only solar power. 

Previously, we got an assortment of solar panels to play with, but due to lack of sun, it’s been impossible to try them out together with the Peltier under good conditions. But this week, together with Janne, we tested the peltier together with a 0.5V solar panel under the “artificial sun” in Janne’s lab. Unfortunately, we did not notice any effect at all with this configuration, which was discouraging. However, according to our calculations, it should be possible, as long as we can increase the voltage. So we got three additional panels from Janne, and Teo and Gustav spent the afternoon soldering components to make testing easier.

Then we connected the four solar panels in series, to achieve 2 Volts, and lit them using a 150W construction lamp, and actually got a noticeable effect. 
And since this was created by a simple artificial light, we expect an even greater effect with the real sun.

What we need to do now is wait for the additional components to arrive, and calculate what area we realistically need to make this work, as well as planning for cooling the hot side of the Peltier elements, probably with some kind of heat sink. 


## Reflections on the first iteration


__Successes__

In the beginning of the project, we were rather uncertain about the product idea, but the feedback we got from our potential users survey and the “buzz” among fellow students was encouraging, and showed that there is actually interest in this product. There were also several concerns raised, which is better than not hearing anything at all. 

This week we have overcome some great technical challenges. We have confirmed that we can get enough power from solar panels to get an noticeable cooling effect from the peltier element we have. It will be easier to develop our ideas further when we can know with certainty what kind of effect we can expect from our cooling system. 

We have also managed to create a good way of working together, by meeting every Monday in person, and being very active on Telegram, sharing our ideas and progress. 

Another success is that we have managed to give convincing presentations and been good at communicating our ideas and plans to the stakeholders. 
 

__Improvement points__

In the coming weeks, we should spend even more time working together in person, as we will be working with physical objects and are attempting to build a prototype.

Even though the feedback we got from the first user survey was very valuable, we intend to improve the process in the next iteration. We need a clearer idea of what information we want, and think about how to best express our questions. We will also attempt to reach more people from different climates in our subsequent surveys to gather a more valuable data set.




__Next iteration__

We are confident enough in our current idea to continue without any drastic changes during the next iteration.
For our next iteration we’ll focus on building a wearable prototype and adding features to it. We’re concerned that the cooling is focused on one area and might therefore feel unpleasant, so we’re thinking of adding some conducting elements to help spread the cooling from the peltier element.
Another concern is that the side of the peltier element that heats up won’t dissipate heat efficiently enough. This is why our next iteration could have some sort of heatsink to help the peltier element transfer heat.

Our approximate schedule going forward:

- Week 44: We have tested more components and made calculations for the final solar panel requirements. We have defined and prepared our next user testing round
- Week 45: We have an actual assembled cap that can work both using solar panels and a battery. 
- Week 46: We have tested the cooling effect on actual users.
