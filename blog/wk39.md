# Week 39 – brainstorming

This was the first “real” work week for Group 21 “Powered by Light”. The goals
for the week was to have our first meeting, getting to know each other,
brainstorming and defining our problem and preparing for the presentation on
Monday.

We used several brainstorming tools during our meeting. The first one was
Brainwriting, where we first wrote down questions on pieces of paper and then
passed them around the team to add ideas. The questions we chose were:

- What are the benefits of using solar power?

- Where can we put power where there currently is none?

- What things are used only when there is light available?

The second tool we used was Negative Brainstorming. We tried to come up with as
many bad and useless reasons to use solar power. Then we looked at the result
and tried to think about what could be changed to make the ideas better.

Lastly we used our own version of Six Thinking Hats. We went throguh all
previous ideas and analyzed them from the following viewpoints (roles):

- Manager
- Emotion
- Creative and Optimist
- Objective and Pessimist

In the end we were happy about the result. We had managed to create many
bad ideas and a few good ones. These were the most promising ideas:

**GPS tags:**

Track animals/people/objects whenever there is light

**Helping the blind:**

Can we use available light to power devices meant to help people with visual impairment.

**Mesh network:**

Cheap devices could be spread over a large area to create a mesh network and provide Internet access

**Cooling:**
Use abundance of sun to cool down objects or people

**Cameras/Microphones:**

Place cheap data-gathering devices that require low maintenance in remote locations

**Concentrating light:**

Use low-intensity available light to produce a high-intensity, more concentrated light.

**E-Ink screens:**

Combine low/no-powered E-ink displays with backlight depending on the available light

After all, we were happy with the outcome of this week. We have
started to get to know each other and are excited about our topic. We
also managed to keep our first meeting rather efficient and effective.
Unfortunately, not everyone was able to attend this time due to
scheduling conflicts, but we had great remote communication. In the
future we will meet at a predefined time every week.
