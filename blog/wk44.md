# Week 44 - Business

## BMC

Below is our Business Model Canvas. Our model has two distinct customer segments, the companies we will be selling our product to, and the end user, the person who actually will be buying our product from the stores. These segments are color coded as blue for companies and yellow for the end-users. 
Our business model revolves around partnering with a sports company that already has brand recognition and market presence.

## Physics

Let’s do some calculations on what is actually needed to achieve the cooling we want. 
If we assume that we want the cold side of the peltier to be around 10°C (much like a fridge-cold coke), and that the hot side will stabilize at 10°C above the ambient temperature, we would like to achieve a temperature delta of 20–30°C. 

Since our power source is limited, it seems more realistic to use [TEC1-04905](http://www.thermonamic.com/TEC1-04905-English.pdf) (designed for a voltage of 5) instead of TEC1-12706 (designed for a voltage of 12). Looking at the data sheet for TEC1-04905, we can see in the graph _Qc = f(V)_, i.e., “Cooling effect as a function of Voltage, at different temperature differences”, that 2 V should will cause cooling up until a temperature difference of about 35°C. 

We can also see from the graph _Qc = f(DT)_, i.e., “Cooling effect as a function of temperature difference, at different Currents”, that when supplying 1 A, we will get a cooling effect up to a temperature difference at around 30 °C. 

Additionally, to see the efficiency, we look at the graph _COP = f(V)_, i.e., “Coefficient of performance (cooling effect divided by input power) as a function of Voltage, at different temperature difference levels.” Here we see that using 2 V, at both 20–30°C temperature difference, __we are close to the maximum efficiency__. This should help us avoid heating up the hot side of the element unnecessarily and achieve the maximum cooling effect with our limited power supply. 

__In conclusion, it seems that we should aim for a target voltage of 2, and make sure that the solar cells can provide that voltage at a current of 1A.__

Very rough calculations of the size of the cap, as seen straight from above, when the sun is as strongest, gives an area of around 2.6 dm². Since solar cells typically can absorb 10 W/dm² at 10% efficiency, we can assume to get around 2.6 W of power. Since we know that we want 2 V, we simply divide the power by voltage to get current: __1.3 A, which should be enough according to these calculations__. 

An important design decision is whether to connect several 2 V elements in parallel, or lower voltage elements in series. Under ideal conditions, there should be no difference. However, since the sun in not reaching all parts of the cap at the same time, some panel will be in shade and might cause the system to not work if connected in series. Therefore, it seems safer to use 2 V elements connected in parallel. 

Since the system is unlikely to produce a cooling effect for a longer period of time, it might be advisable to maximize the sensation of cold by toggling the power on and off at regular intervals. This will allow the peltier elements to return to ambient temperatures, and work more efficiently again. 


## Future

Our next plans is to test the peltier element in practice. We will test them using a battery and see how the effect feels. This will help us finalize the design of the prototype. We will also contact experts and validate our physics calculations and order more components as needed.
