# Week 46 - Planning the Finale

This week we’ve started planning for the Grand Finale, gotten more components for the prototype and performed additional user testing. 

## Planning

We have identified the remaining parts of this course: 

- Finishing the prototype
- Gathering additional information from users
- Creating the Poster
- Preparing the final presentation and slides
- Creating the final artifact

We’ve divided the labor to be able to work effectively, and held mini-workshops to get everyone started. 


## Prototype building

We bought on-off-on switch to easily switch power between two cooling elements. In our tests we found that each element should be on for about five seconds at a time to get optimal cooling effect. Later we will build some kind of an automatic switch to test our prototype for longer periods of time. We also bought some heatsinks to be attached to the cap later.

## User Testing

We needed to validate our placement of the peltier elements, for which we conducted some user testing. We used room temperature spoons or ones which were cooled down with running water and asked subjects to place them on their foreheads where the cooling effect was the best.  We had hypothesized that placement on the temples gave the strongest cooling effect and according to feedback we were correct. 15 out of 20 subjects thought that the cooling effect felt best near the temple area.
