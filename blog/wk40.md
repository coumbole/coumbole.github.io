# Week 40 â€“ Refining

This week we had an interesting meeting with Janne, our product owner, where we learned more about solar cells, discussed different possibilities and got to borrow a few cells to play with.

After discussion and feedback, we concluded that the original GPS-tracking idea presented last Monday is probably not the best way to go, because of the lack of need to be battery-less and difficulty to interact with potential customers, in the case of wildlife tracking. 

We performed an "Opportunity tournament" with our best ideas to compare them and find the best one.

## Opportunity tournament

__Helping the blind vs GPS tracker__

- There is no benefit of going batteryless for blind people 
- GPS can utilize "batterylessness" better

_KO! GPS WINS!_

__Mesh network vs cooling__

- Cooling is more practical and easier to implement/approach
- To make a mesh network reliable you would need many devices and a lot of sunlight

_COOLING TAKES IT!_

__Camera/Microphone vs Concentrating light__

- Cameras might take too much power to operate without batteries?
- Concentrating light: Lack of use cases
- Concentrating light: What's really the point? Stupid? :O

_CAMERA! CAMERA! CAMERA_

__E-ink screens vs. alarm__

- Simple, easy to implement available
- Alarm: Easy for the team to understand, and to build a prototype
- E-ink displays don't have to be on all the time

_BEEEEP! ALARM ADVAANCES!_

__GPS vs. Cooling__

- Harder to do as a project since the team doesn't have access to end users
- GPS only in light seems counter-intuitive
- GPS works in pulses, which won't work well with the constant power of solar panels
- Cooling is needed more depending on the sunlight intensity

_SO COOL!_

__Camera vs. Alarm__

- Solar power for cameras might not be reliable enough
- Camera: Lack of use case
- Alarm: Clear use case

_AAAAALAAAARM WINS! MY GOD WHAT A KNOCKOUT!_

__Alarm vs. Cooling__

- Alarm relying only on solar power is not secure / reliable
- Cooling seems very intuitive 
- Cooling presents more possibilities

_WHAT A FINALE! SUCH A GAME! BUT IN THE END, COOLING IS THE TOURNAMENT CHAMPION!
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WINNER!_


So we concluded that cooling is the best way forward, and created our Mission Statement: _"We bring amenity, convenience and eco-friendliness to the lives of people in hot, sunny environments"_.

The next steps will be finishing the Project Plan, and start thinking about prototypes.
