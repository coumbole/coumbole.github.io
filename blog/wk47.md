# Week 47 - The final submission

This week has gone by with a lot of work put into the final return for the course. We’ve been working efficiently towards getting everything done in time, and have had surprisingly few struggles along the way.

## The prototype

We’ve been finishing the building of the prototype this week. One of the biggest improvements are the heatsinks that we added to the sides of the prototype to help the peltier-elements radiate the heat outside the cap. The heatsinks seem to be working quite decently, and also add an interesting look to our cap. Of course the main focus of this prototype is functionality, and we aren’t too concerned of its looks. Despite of its looks, Gustav got some really good pictures of the cap!

## The poster

We’ve also gotten quite far with the poster, and now that we have some good pictures of our prototype, it really improved the look of the poster. The design of the poster is aiming to look modern, sleek and also a bit athletic. We’ve chosen a cold color scheme with different shades of blue as our main colours. This should convey that the purpose of our product is cooling. The highlights are in orange, since it’s a nice complement to blue, and can also be associated with sunlight and warmth. We didn't want to put too much text or extra elements on the poster, just so that the picture of the cap can be in the focus.
